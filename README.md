There is a pretty straight forward problem with running mystery style ttrpgs solo. Either you create your clues randomly and they do not point to any particular solution and often don't relate to each other, or you know too much and there is no real mystery. This script is designed to pull randomly from a set of JSON files (these are pretty obvious in their format and can be edited in any text editor. Just make sure you dont change anything not in quotes.) and use that file to reveal any number of clues in order and a plot twist and the solution each on command. 

I have been testing this primarily with Vaesen and it's solo rules. It could be adapted to many systems though. Anything where you need to reveal things in order. Currently the Mysteries are filled with examples (generated by AI) for all the Vaesen in the primary Core book. Please purchase a copy for yourself and support this great game!

Other systems you might want to look at include:
- Gumshoe
- Dresden Files
- Bindlewood Bay
- City of Mist
- Monster of the Week

So fill your mysteries directory with mysteries appropriate to your game and then just run

> python mystery.py

Enjoy.
